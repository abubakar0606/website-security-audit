 Understanding & Scope 

From a SOC perspective, a Web Security Audit is the process of
reviewing a website to identify weaknesses that could be exploited
by attackers. The main goal is to protect user data, system integrity,
and business operations.

Penetration testing is used by SOC teams to simulate attacker behavior
in a controlled way in order to evaluate security controls and improve
defense mechanisms.

A vulnerability is any weakness in a web application that can be
exploited to compromise confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
SOC teams classify vulnerabilities based on risk and prioritize fixing
critical issues such as SQL Injection and XSS.

The main focus areas of the audit include:
- Login pages, because they control system access
- Signup forms, which can be abused for attacks
- User profile sections, where personal data is stored
- APIs, which handle backend communication and data exchange

The output of this phase is a clearly defined audit scope that
identifies which parts of the website will be tested and ensures
that testing is performed legally and safely.
