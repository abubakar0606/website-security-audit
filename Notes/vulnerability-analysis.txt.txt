Vulnerability Analysis

In this phase, the vulnerabilities identified during automated and
manual testing are analyzed and classified based on their risk level
and potential impact on the system.

Each vulnerability is documented using the following parameters:
 Name of the vulnerability
 Risk level (Low, Medium, High)
 Description of the issue
 Impact on the system

Example vulnerabilities:

1. SQL Injection
Risk Level: High
Description: User input is not properly validated before being used
in database queries.
Impact: An attacker can access, modify, or delete database records.

2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Risk Level: Medium
Description: User input is reflected on web pages without proper
sanitization.
Impact: An attacker can execute malicious scripts in the user’s browser.

3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Risk Level: Medium
Description: The application does not verify the authenticity of
user requests.
Impact: An attacker can perform unauthorized actions on behalf of
a logged-in user.

Vulnerability analysis helps prioritize security fixes by focusing
on high-risk issues that can cause serious damage.
