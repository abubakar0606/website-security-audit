Security Recommendations

This phase focuses on providing security improvements to fix the
identified vulnerabilities and strengthen the web application.

1. Input Validation:
All user inputs should be validated and sanitized before processing.
This helps prevent SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

2. Prepared Statements:
Database queries should use prepared statements or parameterized
queries instead of directly using user input. This protects the
application from SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

3. CSRF Tokens:
CSRF protection tokens should be implemented in all forms and
state-changing requests. This ensures that requests are coming
from legitimate users and not from malicious websites.

4. Security Headers:
Security headers such as Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options,
and X-Content-Type-Options should be configured to protect users
from common browser-based attacks like XSS and clickjacking.

5. HTTPS:
The website should use HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates to
encrypt data transmitted between users and the server. This helps
protect sensitive information from interception.

Implementing these recommendations will significantly improve
the overall security posture of the web application.
