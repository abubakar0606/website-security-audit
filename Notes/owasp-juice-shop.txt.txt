OWASP Juice Shop is an intentionally vulnerable web application
developed by OWASP for security training and practice. It is designed
to help learners understand common web application vulnerabilities in
a safe and legal environment.

The application simulates a real shopping website with features such
as login, search, and user profiles, but these features contain
deliberate security flaws for learning purposes.

Juice Shop includes vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site
Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and broken
authentication. These vulnerabilities allow students and security
professionals to practice detecting and exploiting weaknesses to
improve their defensive skills.

From a SOC point of view, Juice Shop is used to study how attacks work
and how security teams can detect and prevent them before attackers
use them in real systems.
